What do you think?\r\nDad: That would be wonderful :) But are you sure you can get the time off work?\r\nDonnie: That's what I'm worried about. We always have so much work in December. And everyone in my team would have to agree for me to take the time off.\r\nDad: It doesn't hurt to try, I guess. \r\nDonnie: Yeah, I was thinking about asking my colleagues first, to try and see if they have any plans.\r\nDad: Ok, that's a good start. Which dates were you thinking of?\r\nDonnie: Well, since Christmas is on a Tues, I was thinking of departing the Fri before, so it would be Dec. 21. What do you think?\r\nDad: Great :) The tree and all the decorations will be up by then :)\r\nDonnie: I have a request, though. Do you think you can lend me $250? I'm a little short.\r\nDad: Of course :) Maybe we can do a little more than that even. Your mom and I would be so thrilled to have you this Christmas.\r\nDonnie: :) I remember the last time I was there for Christmas. It was definitely one of my all-time fav. Christmases.\r\nDad: Yeah, that was when we had the house in Pelham. Sometimes I regret selling that place.\r\nDonnie: Yeah, it's too bad. It was so peaceful and serene.\r\nDad: You know that it's actually up for sale now? But the owners have devastated the place. You can check for yourself. It's all on mls.com\r\nDonnie: Really?? You can buy it again :)\r\nDad: I wish! They're asking for 100,000 more.\r\nDonnie: Wow, real estate is going through the roof these days. I wonder how I'd ever get back into the market if I went back. Anyways, I'll talk to you later. Jenny wants to go shopping now.\r\nDad: Ok, tell me how it turns out at work and say hi to Jenny for me.\r\nDonnie: No problem. Bye, and remember to take care of yourself.\r\nDad: Thanks, bye.\r\nDonnie: Bye\nsummary: \nDonnie expresses homesickness and considers flying home for Christmas.

He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers.

Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more.

We really need your help here.\r\nMark: That's not really that important. I just need to make a few phone calls. When will you be back, Mr. Benson?\r\nMr. Benson: On Tuesday. Thank you, Mark. \r\nMark: Can I have Wednesday or Thursday off then? \r\nMr. Benson: Of course. I'll tell Lona later to book both days for you. One is on the company.\r\nMark: Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. \r\nMr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction.

Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?\r\nMash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.\r\nGina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?\r\nMash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well.
