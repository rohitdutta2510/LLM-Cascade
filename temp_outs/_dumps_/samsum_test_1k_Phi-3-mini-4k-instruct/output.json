Is it difficult? \r\nSheryl: Honestly, it was quite difficult in the beginning with the language because everything is in English, but because I did a foundation year abroad as well, and I learned academic English, I was already somehow more prepared for what was coming next\r\nRichelle: And what do you study?\r\nSheryl: I am in my 3rd year studying psychology !!\r\nRichelle: Seriously? That's what I want to study as well!\r\nSheryl: Oh that's great ahah, I really like the course and the way they assess us with the assignments, all the topics seem to be very interesting and you end up doing a lot of research. I am sure you will like it too\r\nRichelle: Cool! And what about people there? I'm asking because I am a bit shy 😞\r\nSheryl: Studying abroad is honestly a new world. You see people from different parts of the world, and the most exciting thing is that you actually have things in common with them. Although let me tell you you have to be very open minded\r\nRichelle: Have you had any unpleasant situations there?\r\nSheryl: Yes, I have, unfortunately, when you are abroad, you start thinking about things you probably have never thought about before, things like stereotypes ..\r\nRichelle: Wow... what happened?\r\nSheryl: I guess we, unconsciously, treat people differently or just make up our minds, even before we know them. But don't be scared, seriously! I was shy in my first days too, and I thought everyone looks very confident, but trust me everyone feels exactly like you in their first days\r\nRichelle: 🙂 I'm really afraid and exciting of going to study abroad. And please tell me, is the living expensive there?\r\nSheryl: I guess it is more expensive than in Portugal as we have pounds, but groceries have almost the same prices\r\nRichelle: Ok, thanks a lot! You helped me a lot! I will contact with you if I have any other questions! Enjoy your day!\nsummary: \n\nSheryl, a psychology student in her third year at a Scottish university, shares her experiences with Richelle, who is considering studying abroad. Sheryl explains that the university was initially challenging due to the language barrier, but her foundation year abroad helped her prepare. She enjoys her psychology course and the assignments, which involve a lot of research. Sheryl advises Richelle to be open-minded and not to be intimidated by",
        "Summarize the given dialogue. Keep the summary short.\ndialogue: Gloria: Hi Tony, meant to ask you about it for some time now. Will a possible Brexit affect your business?\r\nTony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I’m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\nsummary: \n\nTony expresses concern about Brexit's impact on his printing business, noting a decrease in foreign commissions and potential economic hardship. He also discusses the negative effects on tourism and the possibility of a second referendum. Gloria suggests visiting each other to mitigate the financial impact. Tony fears a new conflict over the Irish border issue.\n\n\nSummarize the given dialogue. Keep the summary short.\ndialogue: Gl",

Just teen hijinx, is it!?\r\nSue: No, indeed! It started off ok as we booked the village hall for the right day and almost everyone she invited was able to come. \r\nLouise: Yes, it's unusual to get teenagers to reply to invitations! Did you stay for the night?\r\nSue: No, she begged us not to come! We set everything up, decs, drinks etc, nice buffet, but then we made ourselves scarce, we only live on the next street, you see. We decided to pop back in a few hours. That was very naive of us, to be honest!\r\nLouise: I'm guessing things didn't actually go smoothly!\r\nSue: Understatement of the year! Pete went back round about 11.00 and there was utter carnage! There was vomit and spilled drinks everywhere, the front window had been smashed, the bathroom door had come off it's hinges and the mother and toddler toys and books were ripped and strewn about all over the place. Pete roared at Lara and turned the music off. Nobody moved at first, but he threatened to call the police!\r\nLouise: Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I bet she was thoroughly embarrassed.\r\nSue: No, not really. About 8 of her friends were sleeping at our house, so they all crashed back there sheepishly.\r\nLouise: Yes, but next day, she must have apologised to you.\r\nSue: She did not! In fact, around 6 of the group came back to the Hall to help clean up, but Lara refused to get out of bed!\r\nLouise: I can't believe she acted so selfishly! \r\nSue: We've made her pay for the damage out of her part time job at the vets and also refused to pay for one of her holidays. \r\nLouise: Yes, you did right! So she's got more than one holiday?\r\nSue: Yes, three! One she paid for herself, mind. She's still hardly speaking to us and it was 2 weeks ago. \r\nLouise: So sorry you've had to go through this, Lara needs to step up here, though!\r\nSue: I know, I think she'll come round. I have a feeling someone sneaked some drugs in and it made a few of them go apeshit! Hope Lara didn't have any.\r\nLouise: I'm sure things will improve. Come and see us all next weekend.

I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.\r\nHaley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? \r\nNick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.\r\nHaley: obviously :P\r\nHaley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players\r\nNick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?\r\nHaley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.\r\nNick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?\r\nHaley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.\r\nNick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.\r\nHaley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?\r\nNick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.\r\nHaley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago.

I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.\r\nHaley: i dindn't really see it that way.

How are you?\r\nPat: I'm very well! I haven't seen you girls in about 35 years! I left in 84, we went to run a pub, me and Jonathan.\r\nSandra: Well, you'll never believe it, but Brenda Riley tracked me down like this and we met up last weekend! We thought we might get the old Lister's gang together for a reunion, you know, before we're all too old!\r\nPat: You're not too old, you were all young girls out of school then!\r\nSandra: Yes, but that was almost 50 years ago, Pat! We're all grannies now!\r\nPat: Not me, we never had kids, our choice!\r\nSandra: You have no regrets, then?\r\nPat: Bit personal, dear! No, we retired from the pub 10 years ago, mid-60s, me and Jon have had a ball, cruises, safaris and I've seen my sister in Oz and my brother in Thailand several times.\r\nSandra: Oh Pat, that sounds lovely!

I heard Marigold had passed away, you know, the supervisor?\r\nSandra: Yes, very sad, not long after Lister's closed, I think.\r\nPat: Ok, what about that young girl who loved David Bowie, joined us in about 73, only about 16 she was, I think. She always tried to match his current look, you remember when she did Ziggy Stardust with ginger hair and no eyebrows!\r\nSandra: Oh yes, Amanda Johnson, she was even younger than me and Brenda! She's still over 60 now though! She may well be on Facebook, did she get married, do you remember?\r\nPat: Not sure, could be tricky tracking all these down, so many common names!\r\nSandra: Oh yes, Magda Zielinski was in our section too! Maybe an easier name to find. Her mum was Polish, I think.\r\nPat: Oh yes, Magda, what a beauty! She was like one of the girls from Charlie's Angels, the blonde one.\r\nSandra: Yes, Farrah Fawcett, with the lovely hairstyle! I think Magda should have been a model, not a machinist!\r\nPat: Well, Sand, lovely to hear from you, please keep in touch about the reunion, or just for a chat!

You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.\r\nJennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.\r\nMary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.\r\nJennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?\r\nMary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…\r\nJennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.\r\nMary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…\r\nJennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.\r\nMary: Good. It is easier to convince people and to hold their attention with actual data. It would be even better if you show some pictures along the way. Do you have any?\r\nJennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.\r\nMary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.\r\nJennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?\r\nMary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.\r\nJennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.\r\nMary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.\r\nJennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.\r\nMary: If you are really prepared, it will be a piece of cake. You will be able to speak with ease and confidence, and you will be amazed by how well you can express yourself.\r\nJennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.\r\nMary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.\r\nJennifer: You are absolutely right. I will take time to practice and to learn to relax and express myself really well. Wish me luck, Mary!\r\nMary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!\nsummary: "
