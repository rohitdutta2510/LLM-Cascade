Your mom and I would be so thrilled to have you this Christmas.\r\nDonnie: :) I remember the last time I was there for Christmas. It was definitely one of my all-time fav. Christmases.\r\nDad: Yeah, that was when we had the house in Pelham. Sometimes I regret selling that place.\r\nDonnie: Yeah, it's too bad. It was so peaceful and serene.\r\nDad: You know that it's actually up for sale now? But the owners have devastated the place. You can check for yourself. It's all on mls.com\r\nDonnie: Really?? You can buy it again :)\r\nDad: I wish! They're asking for 100,000 more.\r\nDonnie: Wow, real estate is going through the roof these days. I wonder how I'd ever get back into the market if I went back. Anyways, I'll talk to you later. Jenny wants to go shopping now.\r\nDad: Ok, tell me how it turns out at work and say hi to Jenny for me.\r\nDonnie: No problem.

Then there's Darren, Susie and the kids, stuck with them too!\r\nJoan: Oh sis, you have no imagination! Darren and Susie would love some nice wine, cheese and biscuits.

I've witnessed them 👀 And here's a photo of the heroes <file_photo>\r\nJuan: Ha ha ha thanks Clarice. Yeah, I think it went ok, what would you say Rob?\r\nRob: I can't remember anything. Panel blackout! ⚫\r\nHugh: Any annoying questions from the audience?\r\nRob: ⚫\r\nHugh: lol\r\nClarice: Well, I don't know what the guys think but I personally think the guy who chaired Rob's panel was a little bit of a dickhead, wasn't he?\r\nRob: 🔴 Yeah, a total dick. He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.\r\nClarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual\r\nHugh: Fuck, sounds insane\r\nJuan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the \"question\" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority 💖\r\nHugh: Ha ha ha how so\r\nClarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face\r\nJuan: Sounds like a nice prelude 🎼\r\nRob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature 😂😂😂😂\r\nClarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...\r\nRob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval\r\nJuan: Sounds really bizarre... So Rob, what's History? What's Literature? What's Art?\r\nRob: Oh fuck off lol\r\nClarice: You can purchase advance tickets for Rob for 10 EUR; tickets at the entrance cost 12 EUR\r\nRob: 😂😂😂\r\nJuan: Rob sure deserves a glass of wine tonight\r\nRob: We all do.

Except for the latter, nothing too urgent that cannot be put off until later.\r\nAndy: I have a huge deadline for tomorrow and really have to focus on it.

We really need your help here.\r\nMark: That's not really that important. I just need to make a few phone calls. When will you be back, Mr. Benson?\r\nMr. Benson: On Tuesday. Thank you, Mark. \r\nMark: Can I have Wednesday or Thursday off then? \r\nMr. Benson: Of course. I'll tell Lona later to book both days for you. One is on the company.\r\nMark: Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. \r\nMr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction. Lona has the survey, so ask her for it. \r\nClaudia: Of course. \r\nMr. Benson: You don't have much time, because I'll need the processed data by 11.\r\nClaudia: You'll have it on your e-mail by 10:30.\r\nMark: I'm back.\r\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Claudia. Andy - I need you to prepare a presentation on our company. Something for laymen, not too complicated and not too specialised. A lot of positive figures.\r\nAndy: No problem, sir.

Mark - you get the hardest task. I want you to do some data mining.\r\nMark: Data mining? What am I looking for?\r\nMr. Benson: I want you to pull everything you can find on our clients' financial situation before the agreement with us, one month after signing and their current standing. \r\nMark: That's a lot of work.

Just enough commissions to keep me busy without overworking. Enough money too. And you?\r\nMash: I still work about 12-15 hours a week, which with my rental means that I am not dipping into my savings too much.\r\nGina: Sounds good. Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?\r\nMash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.\r\nGina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?\r\nMash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?\r\nGina: Tina?\r\nMash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.\r\nGina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?\r\nMash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.\r\nGina: Has she retired yet?!\r\nMash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.\r\nGina: And you, old man?\r\nMash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.\r\nGina: And the estate? The rents?\r\nMash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze\r\nMash: D‑':\r\nMash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don’t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.\r\nGina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.\r\nMash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.\r\nGina: Good old Mash!\r\nMash: It's me!\r\nGina: How grand to hear your news! \r\nMash: You must come and visit me again.\r\nGina: We'll think about it!\r\nMash: :)\nsummary:  Mash and Gina catch up on their lives.

Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.\r\nJames: Cool, never thought about it!\r\nJenny: It seems like you are a down-to-earth guy which is probably good for a project manager, but at Netflix we highly value the creative side of people :)\r\nJames: Thank you so much Jenny!
