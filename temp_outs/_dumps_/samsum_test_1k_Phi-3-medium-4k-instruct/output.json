No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I’m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick.

Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely.

Did you stay for the night?\r\nSue: No, she begged us not to come! We set everything up, decs, drinks etc, nice buffet, but then we made ourselves scarce, we only live on the next street, you see. We decided to pop back in a few hours. That was very naive of us, to be honest!\r\nLouise: I'm guessing things didn't actually go smoothly!\r\nSue: Understatement of the year! Pete went back round about 11.00 and there was utter carnage! There was vomit and spilled drinks everywhere, the front window had been smashed, the bathroom door had come off it's hinges and the mother and toddler toys and books were ripped and strewn about all over the place.

You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.\r\nJennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.\r\nMary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.\r\nJennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?\r\nMary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…\r\nJennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.\r\nMary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…\r\nJennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet.
