You usually have a great time.\r\nDeirdre: Well, we do, but the complex has been taken over by new management and they are a bunch of lazy twats, not to put too fine a point on it!\r\nSharon: Oh my God, what did they do?\r\nDeirdre: How long have you got! First, we booked in and they'd given away the only ground floor apartment available to someone else, so I was cross to begin with. I was watching little Ben like a hawk around that balcony. I did specify ground floor only when we booked too!\r\nSharon: How irritating!\r\nDeirdre: Exactly! Well, next day, we all decided to go in the pool, James and Ben went in the toddler pool and I took Rosie and Megan in the big one with me as they can swim pretty well. Next thing we know, we have to get out as our eyes are streaming and Ben has grabbed a large floating toddler poo from his pool and is playing with it!\r\nSharon: That's vile, was it chemicals in the pool that did it?\r\nDeirdre: Yep, far too much chlorine, awful. We could hardly see for a couple of hours and both pools were evacuated immediately, of course! So not a great first day!\r\nSharon: You poor things, did  everything improve at all later?\r\nDeirdre: Not really! They did have some great entertainment at night, to be fair, but every other night, they seemed to carry on playing music until 2 or 3 am AND we were right over the bar and restaurant. Awful! We did complain, but nothing was done about it.\r\nSharon: How was the food?\r\nDeirdre: Nice actually, most of the time, but there was so little of it, we were still hungry. The girls being 12 are growing like weeds and need decent amounts. I thought half board would be good, but we had to buy snacks quite a lot of the time to fill the gaps!\r\nSharon: That Vivaldi lot really are shit! The tv adverts make them sound really high end.\r\nDeirdre: Well, we're obviously asking for compensation, especially because of the chlorine incident. A lot of people are furious, you should see the comments on Trip Advisor!\r\nSharon: Gosh, I hope you manage to sort it, what a pain!\r\nDeirdre: Yes, we are certainly not going to that place again. Luckily, the timeshares in the UK have all been fab. Anyway, see you next week, Sharon! Cut and blow dry, Tues. at 6pm, wasn't it?\r\nSharon: Yes, my love. Good luck with your complaint, Bye!\nsummary: \n\nanswer: Deirdre had a disappointing trip to Portugal due to issues with the new management at the complex, including a problematic pool incident, loud music at night, and insuptacious food portions, leading to a decision to seek compensation and avoid future stays there.",
        "Summarize the given dialogue. Keep the summary short.\ndialogue: John: Hey, James. found accommodation?\r\nJames: I am looking for an apartment to rent. what about you?\r\nJohn: Yes me too.. Since my parents’ house is so far away, I need to find an apartment closer to school. I thought you were going to stay at the school dormitory.\r\nJames: I still have not decided whether to stay at the dormitory or not. I am looking at different options to find the cheapest lodging.\r\nJohn: So, what are you looking for?\r\nJames: All I need is a place big enough for my bed, my desk and my television. \r\nJohn: Me too. \r\nJames: How long have you been looking?\r\nJohn: I just started this week. Since school is going to start next month, I figured I better start the process as soon as possible.\r\nJames: It is not easy to find an apartment to your liking that does not cost a lot. I \r\nJohn: Really? Is it that difficult to find an apartment?\r\nJames: No, it is just that everything I like so far is too expensive and way beyond my reach.\r\nJohn: Is it because they are very close to school? I heard that the closer they are to school, the higher the rental cost.\r\nJames: Maybe that is the problem. Since I do not have a car, I need to find something close to school. \r\nJohn: Have you thought about sharing an apartment? If you want, we can find a two bedroom apartment and share it. It may be cheaper that way.\r\nJames: That could solve our problem.\r\nJohn: Wait! Maybe we should talk this over before we decide.James: Right. For this plan to succeed, we need to come up with some sort of agreement or set of rules.\r\nJohn: Here is my first question: What do you do during the weekdays?\r\nJames: I have to go to work from 8:00AM to 12:00PM, and then I have school from 1:00PM to 5:00PM. After that I plan to go home, eat dinner, and work on my school assignments. How about you?\r\nJohn: Well, I have class from 8:00AM to 10:00AM, and then I go to the library to work until 2:00PM. After that, it is school again until 4:00PM. I plan to stay on campus until 6:00PM to work on my computer projects, and then go home to work on my other classes’ assignments.\r\nJames: It is my turn to ask the second question. Do you plan to have your friends over at the apartment very often?\r\nJohn: No, not on weekdays. I want to finish my homework during the weekdays as much as possible. I think half of my weekend will also be reserved for homework. If my friends do stop by, it will probably be during the weekend.\r\nJames: Good, I plan to do the same things during school time. I also plan to visit my parents during the weekend. My mom is a great cook.\r\nJohn: My parents’ house is too far to visit once a week. I will go home to see them and my little brother during the holidays. I need to be happy with whatever foods I cook.\r\nJames: It seems that sharing an apartment with you may work. Do you want to try it?\r\nJohn: Yes. Let’s go in and take a look at this one.\nsummary: \n\n- John and James are both looking for apartments to rent.\n- They consider sharing an apartment to save money.\n- They discuss their schedules and plans for visitors to ensure compatibility.\n- They agree to try out a shared apartment.\n\n- response: John and James are searching for apartments to rent and consider sharing one to save costs. They discuss their schedules and visitor plans, agreeing to try a shared apartment.",
        "Summarize the given dialogue. Keep the summary short.\ndialogue: Doris: Hello my dear! Greetings from a short outing to the Vosges! <file_photo>\r\nTress: How lovely for you! What's Vosges? Pardon my ZA ignorance!\r\nDoris: :)) Most Europeans wouldn't know either. A small mountain range, up to 1500 m, in western France, just across the border from us.\r\nDoris: Am with a lady friend of mine, German. A bit of hiking in the area but staying in one place. She's got her big dog with her and the beast is just divine.\r\nTress: Aren't you so lucky to be able to walk as women alone in parts of Europe? This is unheard of here.\r\nDoris: This freedom of movement, also as a woman alone, driving or walking, city or countryside, this is a measure of a quality of life I take for granted in Europe. As much as I love being in ZA, I find it so difficult to cope with such restrictions. I love ZA dearly but I couldn't live there.\r\nTress: I assure you I hate it as much as you do but it's part and parcel of my existence, so I take THIS for granted.\r\nDoris: Sure enough. When over there, I accept it too and adjust accordingly but in the back of my mind there's this feeling of discomfort.\r\nTress: What's your accommodation like? I've never been to France even.\r\nDoris: Oh it's very very untypical. Here the link:\r\nDoris: A group of Dutch who bought a huge piece of land and live off it. And of paying guests! Everything fanatically organic, environmentally friendly and sustainable. No mobile phones, no cigarettes, no non-biodegradable products...\r\nTress: Sounds a tough regime! Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)\r\nDoris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till! You just take what you need and leave the money in the till.\r\nTress: No!!! Can you imagine anything like that in Khayelitsha?!\r\nDoris: May be more in Khayelitsha that in a mixed race area?\r\nTress: Nowhere in this wretched country. Never.\r\nTress: Look what's been happening here. It's a clip from our local paper: <file_photo>\r\nDoris: Oh no! Horrible HORRIBLE\r\nTress: Our daily news... So enjoy your European paradise Doris!\r\nDoris: It rams it home how lucky we are here. Travelling freely from country to country, meeting freely whoever and wherever. No border controls. \r\nTress: But different languages! I found it so confusing when we flew from England to Amsterdam, then on to Frankfurt and to Rome in the end.\r\nDoris: But everyone speaks English. More or less.\r\nTress: But we two, speaking only English, felt a bit limited. Or it's just our lack of experience in travelling. So much unlike you!\r\nDoris: Oh well... Anyway it's France now in a Dutch colony and there are at least 3 language in the air. It is Europe as well, I guess.\r\nTress: Lucky lucky you...\nsummary: \n\n- [response]: Doris shares her experience in the Vosges mountains in France with Tress, highlighting the freedom of movement and sustainable living there, contrasting it with restrictions in their home country. They discuss the challenges of language barriers and cultural differences in travel."
