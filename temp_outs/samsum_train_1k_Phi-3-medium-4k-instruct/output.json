You're my cousin and we've always got on well, but I'm not going to put my son down and ruin his happiness just because he didn't get bleeding A* grades! \r\nDonna: No, of course.

Jay is a happy, confident boy and I leave him to his own devices because I trust him!\r\nDonna: Well, Oliver has downloaded his reading list already and is working through them. The competition to stand out in law is fierce. A little encouragement wouldn't go amiss for Jay.\r\nRachel: Ok, I've had enough of this conversation! Jay is well adjusted and people like him. That's more than I can say for Oliver!\r\nDonna: Well, we'll see about that in 5 years time when Oliver is earning 6 figures and Jay is still scraping a living doing his weird so-called art!\r\nRachel: Bye Donna, I think you've said quite enough!\nsummary: \n\n- [response]: Donna and Rachel catch up, discussing their children's exam results.

Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?\r\nMash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.\r\nGina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?\r\nMash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well.
