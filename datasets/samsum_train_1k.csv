Jenny: But yeah, I think it's a cool place to work at. My team is absolutely brilliant, people are motivated, inspiring, so I really couldn't ask for more.
James: Do you know then anyone from the business team? It almost sounds to good to be true :)
Jenny: I know a few, they're a nice bunch as well :) There are some ups and downs as everywhere, some things that could be improved, so it's not perfect, but still good.
Jenny: Also, don't forget it IS a corporation and a big one on top of that :D
James: Yeah, that's why I'm so curious about the atmosphere, etc. I've only worked in small companies.
Jenny: So what made you change your mind?

Bill: Ah. Like my evening ""quick fix "" flights. From 15-30 minutes. Depends on conditions of course. My plan is for max 1 hour flights.
Kerry: Exactly, purely a pleasure craft. With the current state of batteries it will be hard to have much more duration and still meet the ""5 gallons of fuel"" ultralight limit. 
Kerry: Even without that limit, adding more range makes the problem exponentially harder. 1 hour can be done but it won't be easy.
Bill: That's where using a ""motor floater"" design is superior. Get up there, turn it off and seek thermals. Just use it to go thermal to thermal. Or get back to the runway.
Kerry: Ah yes, completely agree. 
Kerry: A self launch motorglider is a real good option. It also helps get around the 30 minute min fuel reserve requirement.

Mash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.
Gina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?
Mash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?
Gina: Tina?
Mash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.
Gina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?
Mash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.
Gina: Has she retired yet?!
Mash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.
Gina: And you, old man?
Mash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.
Gina: And the estate? The rents?
Mash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze
Mash: D‑':
Mash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don’t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.
Gina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.
Mash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.
Gina: Good old Mash!
Mash: It's me!
Gina: How grand to hear your news! 
Mash: You must come and visit me again.
Gina: We'll think about it!
Mash: :)

Elsa: It is very interesting. Such a different culture. We've been here for 5 days, so it still feels too new to make any appreciations.
Norma: Has the weather been kind to you all the time?
Elsa: Mostly so, one afternoon looked like heavy rain but turned out to be only a short shower. And so warm you could wash yourself in it!
Norma: Where are you precisely?
Elsa: <file_other>
Norma: Looks like a housing estate, with square blocks, a precise grid of streets and wide avenues leading up to it.
Elsa: It is slightly similar to yours, even with guards and check points, but without high-security fences. Turn on the satellite view to get more details. But the houses are very, very simple. Nothing like your luxurious abodes!
Norma: Mexico is not a very rich country, I understand. But this Merida looks so huge! And you are on the outskirts of it, aren't ?
Elsa: Correct. This part is brand new and fairly well-off by Mexican standards. Lower and middle-middle, I should say. We don't mind being in a suburb since we've got a car. And we've been doing plenty of driving!
Norma: Let me guess: Marcus as macho as ever?
Elsa: You bet! But I simply enjoy it and let him do all the driving if he insists on it.
Norma: Yeap, that's best for both of you. I'm our only driver too now, but it's only because of his post-operative condition. A couple more weeks and we change the wheel.
Elsa: Which is only fair! Oh well...
Norma: Have a lovely rest of your stay in Merida. And send me new pics please!
Elsa: Love!
